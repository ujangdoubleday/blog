# Why Do We Start With "Hello World"?

![First Hello World example](/_sync/images/hello.webp)

The "Hello World" program has become the universal first example when learning any programming language, serving as an initiation ritual for programmers worldwide.

## Origins of Hello World

The phrase traces back to Brian Kernighan's 1972 tutorial for the B programming language. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program), it appeared in Kernighan's 1978 book "The C Programming Language", which became a canonical reference.

**Historical Timeline**:

- **1967**: First documented use in BCPL language (predecessor to B)
- **1972**: Appeared in Kernighan's internal Bell Labs memos about B language
- **1974**: Used in Bell Labs' internal programming manuals
- **1978**: Published in "The C Programming Language" book

## Why It Matters

### Technical Significance

1. **Minimal Viable Program**: Tests basic language syntax
2. **Environment Verification**: Confirms compiler/interpreter works
3. **I/O Testing**: Validates basic input/output functionality

### Cultural Impact

- **Shared Experience**: Common starting point for all programmers
- **Educational Tool**: Simplifies initial learning curve
- **Benchmarking**: Used to compare language syntax

```python
# Modern Python implementation
print("Hello World!")  # Prints to standard output
```

## Hello World in Different Paradigms

| Paradigm        | Language Example  |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| Procedural      | `C`, `Pascal`     |
| Object-Oriented | `Java`, `C#`      |
| Functional      | `Haskell`, `Lisp` |
| Scripting       | `Python`, `Ruby`  |

## Behind the Scenes

What actually happens when you run a Hello World program:

1. **Compilation/Interpretation**:

   - Compiled languages: Converted to machine code
   - Interpreted languages: Processed line-by-line

2. **Execution**:
   - Program loads into memory
   - Calls system output functions
   - Returns exit status

## Modern Variations

Contemporary twists on Hello World:

- **Web Version**: `console.log` in browser dev tools
- **Mobile Apps**: Android Toast messages
- **AI Prompts**: "Say hello world" in ChatGPT
